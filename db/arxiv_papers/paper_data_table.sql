These tests can be derived\nfrom any bipartite non-local game with a classical-quantum gap. Furthermore\nour tests are noise-tolerant in the sense that fault tolerant technologies are\nnot needed to play the games; entanglement distributed over noisy channels can\npass with high probability, making our tests relevant for realistic\nexperimental settings. This is in contrast to, e.g., results on self-testing of\nhigh dimensional entanglement, which are only relevant when the noise rate goes\nto zero with the systems size $n$. As a corollary of our result, we supply a\nlower-bound on the entanglement cost of any state achieving a quantum advantage\nin a bipartite non-local game.
